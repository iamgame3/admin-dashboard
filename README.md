# Admin Dashboard Project
This project is meant to test my ability to create grids and manipulate elements within them. This project will also give me some practice in deciding when to use flexbox vs. grid, however for the sake of this project specifically, I will be using mostly grid.

There isn't any functionality in this web page. Also, the page should look okay at different desktop resolutions but won't look right on mobile. This is because at the time of making this project, I am not yet incorporating a mobile layout into any of my projects.

P.S. This project is a part of The Odin Project's course.
