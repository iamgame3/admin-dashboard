# Admin Dashboard Project (WIP)
This project is meant to test my ability to create grids and manipulate elements within them. This project will also give me some practice in deciding when to use flexbox vs. grid, however for the sake of this project specifically, I will lean more towards grid than flexbox.

At the the time of writing this, there won't be any functionality in the web page. Also, the page should look right at different desktop resolutions but won't look right on mobile. This is because at the time of making this project, I am not yet incorporating a mobile layout into the CSS.

P.S. This project is a part of The Odin Project's course.
